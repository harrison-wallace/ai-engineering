### Added
- Initial repo layout: `skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, plus `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` documenting the conventions.
- `bump-version` skill — bumps the version, syncs it into `README.md`, and writes a CHANGELOG entry derived from the git diff.
- Repo-level versioning: minimal `package.json`, this changelog, and git tags per release.
